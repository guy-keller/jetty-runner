Jetty-Runner
============

A plugin that allows you to quickly run Jetty from IntelliJ IDEA CE. <br>
If you require full Jetty support please consider buying the IntelliJ IDEA Enterprise Edition. <br>
This plugin should be Win / Mac / Linux compatible. <br>
<br>
<b>0.0.2</b> - Second release; <br>
<b>*Note</b>: Debugging is available through 'Remote', the port is configurable within the plugin.<br>
<br>
What's new:<br>
<b>1)</b> Debugger port selector. <br>
<b>2)</b> Better UI Layout. <br>
<b>3)</b> Required values are automatically discovered and set!<br>
<br>
I'm going to start writing those unit tests, soon..<br>
<br><br>

<b>TODO:</b> <br>
<b>1)</b> Debugger port selector; for now its fixed on 5007.<br>
<b>2)</b> Figure out why the debugger doesn't work out of the box; JetBrains?<br>
<b>3)</b> Better UI Layout- BoxLayout is not the greatest; GridBag?<br>
